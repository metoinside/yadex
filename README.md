```

📱 Open http://localhost:3000 to see the app.

> 👩‍💻 Rerun `yarn deploy` whenever you want to deploy new contracts to the frontend. If you haven't made any contract changes, you can run `yarn deploy --reset` for a completely fresh deploy.

## Checkpoint 1: 🔭 The Structure 📺

Navigate to the `Debug Contracts` tab, you should see two smart contracts displayed called `DEX` and `Balloons`.

`packages/hardhat/contracts/Balloons.sol` is just an example ERC20 contract that mints 1000 $BAL to whatever address deploys it.

`packages/hardhat/contracts/DEX.sol` is what we will build in this challenge and you can see it starts instantiating a token (ERC20 interface) that we set in the constructor (on deploy).

> Below is what your front-end will look like with no implementation code within your smart contracts yet. The buttons will likely break because there are no functions tied to them yet!

![ch-4-main](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/se-2-challenges/assets/59885513/930ec64c-d185-4a33-8941-43f44a611231)

> 🎉 You've made it this far in Scaffold-Eth Challenges 👏🏼 . As things get more complex, it might be good to review the design requirements of the challenge first!  
> Check out the empty `DEX.sol` file to see aspects of each function. If you can explain how each function will work with one another, that's great! 😎

> 🚨 🚨 🦖 **The code blobs within the toggles are some examples of what you can use, but try writing the implementation code for the functions first!**

---

## Checkpoint 2: Reserves ⚖️

We want to create an automatic market where our contract will hold reserves of both ETH and 🎈 Balloons. These reserves will provide liquidity that allows anyone to swap between the assets.

Add a couple new variables to `DEX.sol` for `totalLiquidity` and `liquidity`:

<details markdown='1'><summary>👩🏽‍🏫 Solution Code</summary>

```
uint256 public totalLiquidity;
mapping (address => uint256) public liquidity;
```

</details>

These variables track the total liquidity, but also by individual addresses too.
Now, let's create an `init()` function in `DEX.sol` that is payable and then we can define an amount of tokens that it will transfer to itself.

<details markdown='1'><summary> 👨🏻‍🏫 Solution Code</summary>

```
    function init(uint256 tokens) public payable returns (uint256) {
        require(totalLiquidity == 0, "DEX: init - already has liquidity");
        totalLiquidity = address(this).balance;
        liquidity[msg.sender] = totalLiquidity;
        require(token.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), tokens), "DEX: init - transfer did not transact");
        return totalLiquidity;
    }
```

</details>

Calling `init()` will load our contract up with both ETH and 🎈 Balloons.

We can see that the DEX starts empty. We want to be able to call `init()` to start it off with liquidity, but we don’t have any funds or tokens yet. Add some ETH to your local account using the faucet and then find the `00_deploy_your_contract.ts` file. Find and uncomment the lines below and add your front-end address:

```
  // // paste in your front-end address here to get 10 balloons on deploy:
  // await balloons.transfer(
  //   "YOUR_FRONTEND_ADDRESS",
  //   "" + 10 * 10 ** 18
  // );
```

> Run `yarn deploy`.

The front end should show you that you have balloon tokens. We can’t just call `init()` yet because the DEX contract isn’t allowed to transfer ERC20 tokens from our account.

First, we have to call `approve()` on the Balloons contract, approving the DEX contract address to take some amount of tokens.

![balloons-dex-tab](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/se-2-challenges/assets/55535804/710f5c9a-d898-4012-9014-4c46f1de015f)

> 🤓 Copy and paste the DEX address to the _Address Spender_ and then set the amount to 5.  
> You can confirm this worked using the `allowance()` function in `Debug Contracts` tab using your local account address as the owner and the DEX contract address as the spender.

Now we are ready to call `init()` on the DEX, using `Debug Contracts` tab. We will tell it to take 5 of our tokens and send 0.01 ETH with the transaction. Remember in the `Debug Contracts` tab we are calling the functions directly which means we have to convert to wei, so don't forget to multiply those values by 10¹⁸!

![multiply-wei](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/se-2-challenges/assets/55535804/531cab0b-2b37-4489-88c3-d36c0755d2d1)

In the `DEX` tab, to simplify user interactions, we run the conversion (_tokenAmount_ \* 10¹⁸) in the code, so they just have to input the token amount they want to swap or deposit/withdraw.

You can see the DEX contract's value update and you can check the DEX token balance using the `balanceOf` function on the Balloons UI from `DEX` tab.

This works pretty well, but it will be a lot easier if we just call the `init()` function as we deploy the contract. In the `00_deploy_your_contract.ts` script try uncommenting the init section so our DEX will start with 5 ETH and 5 Balloons of liquidity:

```
  // // uncomment to init DEX on deploy:
  // console.log(
  //   "Approving DEX (" + dex.address + ") to take Balloons from main account..."
  // );
  // // If you are going to the testnet make sure your deployer account has enough ETH
  // await balloons.approve(dex.address, ethers.utils.parseEther("100"));
  // console.log("INIT exchange...");
  // await dex.init(ethers.utils.parseEther("5"), {
  //   value: ethers.utils.parseEther("5"),
  //   gasLimit: 200000,
  // });
```

Now when we `yarn deploy --reset` then our contract should be initialized as soon as it deploys and we should have equal reserves of ETH and tokens.

### 🥅 Goals / Checks

- [ ] 🎈 In the DEX tab is your contract showing 5 ETH and 5 Balloons of liquidity?
- [ ] ⚠ If you are planning to submit the challenge make sure to implement the `getLiquidity` getter function in `DEX.sol`

## Checkpoint 3: Price 🤑

This section is directly from the [original tutorial](https://medium.com/@austin_48503/%EF%B8%8F-minimum-viable-exchange-d84f30bd0c90) "Price" section. It outlines the general details of the DEX's pricing model.

If you need some more clarity on how the price in a pool is calculated, [this video](https://youtu.be/IL7cRj5vzEU) by Smart Contract Programmer has a more in-depth explanation.

Now that our contract holds reserves of both ETH and tokens, we want to use a simple formula to determine the exchange rate between the two.
Let’s start with the formula `x * y = k` where `x` and `y` are the reserves:

```
(amount of ETH in DEX ) * ( amount of tokens in DEX ) = k
```

The `k` is called an invariant because it doesn’t change during trades. (The `k` only changes as liquidity is added.) If we plot this formula, we’ll get a curve that looks something like:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12072395/205343533-7e3a2cfe-8329-42af-a35d-6352a12bf61e.png)

> 💡 We are just swapping one asset for another, the “price” is basically how much of the resulting output asset you will get if you put in a certain amount of the input asset.

🤔 OH! A market based on a curve like this will always have liquidity, but as the ratio becomes more and more unbalanced, you will get less and less of the less-liquid asset from the same trade amount. Again, if the smart contract has too much ETH and not enough $BAL tokens, the price to swap $BAL tokens to ETH should be more desirable.

When we call `init()` we passed in ETH and $BAL tokens at a ratio of 1:1. As the reserves of one asset changes, the other asset must also change inversely in order to maintain the constant product formula (invariant `k`).

Now, try to edit your `DEX.sol` smart contract and bring in a price function!

<details markdown='1'><summary>👩🏽‍🏫 Solution Code</summary>

```

    function price(
        uint256 xInput,
        uint256 xReserves,
        uint256 yReserves
    ) public pure returns (uint256 yOutput) {
        uint256 xInputWithFee = xInput * 997;
        uint256 numerator = xInputWithFee * yReserves;
        uint256 denominator = (xReserves * 1000) + xInputWithFee;
        return (numerator / denominator);
    }

```

</details>

We use the ratio of the input vs output reserve to calculate the price to swap either asset for the other. Let’s deploy this and poke around:

```
yarn run deploy
```

Let’s say we have 1 million ETH and 1 million tokens, if we put this into our price formula and ask it the price of 1000 ETH it will be an almost 1:1 ratio:

![price-example-1](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/se-2-challenges/assets/55535804/e2d725cc-91f3-454d-902f-b39e4b51f5e2)

If we put in 1000 ETH we will receive 996 tokens. If we’re paying a 0.3% fee it should be 997 if everything was perfect. BUT, there is a tiny bit of slippage as our contract moves away from the original ratio. Let’s dig in more to really understand what is going on here.
Let’s say there is 5 million ETH and only 1 million tokens. Then, we want to put 1000 tokens in. That means we should receive about 5000 ETH:

![price-example-2](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/se-2-challenges/assets/55535804/349db3d8-e39e-4c94-8026-e01da2cefb8e)

Finally, let’s say the ratio is the same but we want to swap 100,000 tokens instead of just 1000. We’ll notice that the amount of slippage is much bigger. Instead of 498,000 back we will only get 453,305 because we are making such a big dent in the reserves.

![price-example-3](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/se-2-challenges/assets/55535804/f479d7cd-0e04-4aa7-aa52-cef30d747af3)

❗️ The contract automatically adjusts the price as the ratio of reserves shifts away from the equilibrium. It’s called an 🤖 _Automated Market Maker (AMM)._

### 🥅 Goals / Checks

- [ ] 🤔 Do you understand how the x\*y=k price curve actually works? Write down a clear explanation for yourself and derive the formula for price. You might have to shake off some old algebra skills!
- [ ] 💃 You should be able to go through the price section of this tutorial with the sample numbers and generate the same outputChange variable.

> 💡 _Hints:_ For more information on calculating the Output Reserve, read the Brief Revisit of Uniswap V2 in [this article](https://hackernoon.com/formulas-of-uniswap-a-deep-dive).

> 💡💡 _More Hints:_ Also, don't forget to think about how to implement the trading fee. Solidity doesn't allow for decimals, so one way that contracts are written to implement percentage is using whole uints (997 and 1000) as numerator and denominator factors, respectively.

---

## Checkpoint 4: Trading 🤝

Let’s edit the `DEX.sol` smart contract and add two new functions for swapping from each asset to the other, `ethToToken()` and `tokenToEth()`!

<details markdown='1'><summary>👨🏻‍🏫 Solution Code </summary>

```
    /**
     * @notice sends Ether to DEX in exchange for $BAL
     */
    function ethToToken() public payable returns (uint256 tokenOutput) {
        require(msg.value > 0, "cannot swap 0 ETH");
        uint256 ethReserve = address(this).balance - msg.value;
        uint256 token_reserve = token.balanceOf(address(this));
        uint256 tokenOutput = price(msg.value, ethReserve, token_reserve);

        require(token.transfer(msg.sender, tokenOutput), "ethToToken(): reverted swap.");
        emit EthToTokenSwap(msg.sender, tokenOutput, msg.value);
        return tokenOutput;
    }

    /**
     * @notice sends $BAL tokens to DEX in exchange for Ether
     */
    function tokenToEth(uint256 tokenInput) public returns (uint256 ethOutput) {
        require(tokenInput > 0, "cannot swap 0 tokens");
        uint256 token_reserve = token.balanceOf(address(this));
        uint256 ethOutput = price(tokenInput, token_reserve, address(this).balance);
        require(token.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), tokenInput), "tokenToEth(): reverted swap.");
        (bool sent, ) = msg.sender.call{ value: ethOutput }("");
        require(sent, "tokenToEth: revert in transferring eth to you!");
        emit TokenToEthSwap(msg.sender, tokenInput, ethOutput);
        return ethOutput;
    }
```

</details>

> 💡 Each of these functions should calculate the resulting amount of output asset using our price function that looks at the ratio of the reserves vs the input asset. We can call tokenToEth and it will take our tokens and send us ETH or we can call ethToToken with some ETH in the transaction and it will send us $BAL tokens. Deploy it and try it out!

### 🥅 Goals / Checks

- [ ] Can you trade ETH for Balloons and get the correct amount?
- [ ] Can you trade Balloons for ETH?

> ⚠ When trading Balloons for ETH remember about allowances. Try using `approve()` to approve the contract address for some amount of tokens, then try the trade again!

---

## Checkpoint 5: Liquidity 🌊

So far, only the `init()` function controls liquidity. To make this more decentralized, it would be better if anyone could add to the liquidity pool by sending the DEX both ETH and tokens at the correct ratio.

Let’s create two new functions that let us deposit and withdraw liquidity. How would you write this function out? Try before taking a peak!

> 💬 _Hint:_
> The `deposit()` function receives ETH and also transfers $BAL tokens from the caller to the contract at the right ratio. The contract also tracks the amount of liquidity (how many liquidity provider tokens (LPTs) minted) the depositing address owns vs the totalLiquidity.

> 💡 **Remember**: Every time you perform actions with your $BAL tokens (deposit, exchange), you'll need to call `approve()` from the `Balloons.sol` contract **to authorize the DEX address to handle a specific number of your $BAL tokens**. To keep things simple, you can just do that from `Debug Contracts` tab, **ensure you approve a large enough quantity of tokens to not face allowance problems**.

> 💬💬 _More Hints:_ The `withdraw()` function lets a user take his Liquidity Provider Tokens out, withdrawing both ETH and $BAL tokens out at the correct ratio. The actual amount of ETH and tokens a liquidity provider withdraws could be higher than what they deposited because of the 0.3% fees collected from each trade. It also could be lower depending on the price fluctuations of $BAL to ETH and vice versa (from token swaps taking place using your AMM!). The 0.3% fee incentivizes third parties to provide liquidity, but they must be cautious of [Impermanent Loss (IL)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XJ1MSTEuU0&t=2s&ab_channel=Finematics).

<details markdown='1'><summary>👩🏽‍🏫 Solution Code </summary>

```
    function deposit() public payable returns (uint256 tokensDeposited) {
        require(msg.value > 0, "Must send value when depositing");
        uint256 ethReserve = address(this).balance - msg.value;
        uint256 tokenReserve = token.balanceOf(address(this));
        uint256 tokenDeposit;

        tokenDeposit = (msg.value * tokenReserve / ethReserve) + 1;
        // 💡 Discussion on adding 1 wei at end of calculation   ^
        // -> https://t.me/c/1655715571/106

        uint256 liquidityMinted = msg.value * totalLiquidity / ethReserve;
        liquidity[msg.sender] += liquidityMinted;
        totalLiquidity += liquidityMinted;

        require(token.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), tokenDeposit));
        emit LiquidityProvided(msg.sender, liquidityMinted, msg.value, tokenDeposit);
        return tokenDeposit;
    }

    function withdraw(uint256 amount) public returns (uint256 eth_amount, uint256 token_amount) {
        require(liquidity[msg.sender] >= amount, "withdraw: sender does not have enough liquidity to withdraw.");
        uint256 ethReserve = address(this).balance;
        uint256 tokenReserve = token.balanceOf(address(this));
        uint256 ethWithdrawn;

        ethWithdrawn = amount * ethReserve / totalLiquidity;

        uint256 tokenAmount = amount * tokenReserve / totalLiquidity;
        liquidity[msg.sender] -= amount;
        totalLiquidity -= amount;
        (bool sent, ) = payable(msg.sender).call{ value: ethWithdrawn }("");
        require(sent, "withdraw(): revert in transferring eth to you!");
        require(token.transfer(msg.sender, tokenAmount));
        emit LiquidityRemoved(msg.sender, amount, ethWithdrawn, tokenAmount);
        return (ethWithdrawn, tokenAmount);
    }

```

 </details>

🚨 Take a second to understand what these functions are doing if you pasted them into your `DEX.sol` file in packages/hardhat/contracts:

### 🥅 Goals / Checks

- [ ] 💧 Deposit liquidity, and then check your liquidity amount through the mapping in the debug tab. Has it changed properly? Did the right amount of assets get deposited?

- [ ] 🧐 What happens if you `deposit()` at the beginning of the deployed contract, then another user starts swapping out for most of the balloons, and then you try to withdraw your position as a liquidity provider? Answer: you should get the amount of liquidity proportional to the ratio of assets within the isolated liquidity pool. It will not be 1:1.

---

## Checkpoint 6: UI 🖼

Cool beans! Your front-end should be showing something like this now!

![reserve-graph-updating](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/se-2-challenges/assets/55535804/ef5ddc5f-2fc8-4bb6-910f-d6c17e579a74)

Now, a user can just enter the amount of ETH or tokens they want to swap and the chart will display how the price is calculated. The user can also visualize how larger swaps result in more slippage and less output asset.

### ⚔️ Side Quests

- [ ] In `packages\nextjs\pages\events.tsx` implement an event and emit for the `approve()` function to make it clear when it has been executed.

### ⚠️ Test it!

- Now is a good time to run `yarn test` to run the automated testing function. It will test that you hit the core checkpoints. You are looking for all green checkmarks and passing tests!

---

## Checkpoint 7: 💾 Deploy your contracts! 🛰

📡 Edit the `defaultNetwork` to [your choice of public EVM networks](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/networks/) in `packages/hardhat/hardhat.config.ts`

🔐 You will need to generate a **deployer address** using `yarn generate` This creates a mnemonic and saves it locally.

👩‍🚀 Use `yarn account` to view your deployer account balances.

⛽️ You will need to send ETH to your deployer address with your wallet, or get it from a public faucet of your chosen network.

🚀 Run `yarn deploy` to deploy your smart contracts to a public network (selected in `hardhat.config.ts`)

> 💬 Hint: You can set the `defaultNetwork` in `hardhat.config.ts` to `sepolia` **OR** you can `yarn deploy --network sepolia`.

> 💬💬 More Hints: For faster loading of your _"Events"_ page, consider updating the `fromBlock` passed to `useScaffoldEventHistory` in [`packages/nextjs/pages/events.tsx`](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/se-2-challenges/blob/challenge-4-dex/packages/nextjs/pages/events.tsx) to `blocknumber - 10` at which your contract was deployed. Example: `fromBlock: 3750241n` (where `n` represents its a [BigInt](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/BigInt)). To find this blocknumber, search your contract's address on Etherscan and find the `Contract Creation` transaction line.

---

## Checkpoint 8: 🚢 Ship your frontend! 🚁

✏️ Edit your frontend config in `packages/nextjs/scaffold.config.ts` to change the `targetNetwork` to `chains.sepolia` or any other public network.

💻 View your frontend at http://localhost:3000 and verify you see the correct network.

📡 When you are ready to ship the frontend app...

📦 Run `yarn vercel` to package up your frontend and deploy.

> Follow the steps to deploy to Vercel. Once you log in (email, github, etc), the default options should work. It'll give you a public URL.

> If you want to redeploy to the same production URL you can run `yarn vercel --prod`. If you omit the `--prod` flag it will deploy it to a preview/test URL.

> 🦊 Since we have deployed to a public testnet, you will now need to connect using a wallet you own or use a burner wallet. By default 🔥 `burner wallets` are only available on `hardhat` . You can enable them on every chain by setting `onlyLocalBurnerWallet: false` in your frontend config (`scaffold.config.ts` in `packages/nextjs/`)

#### Configuration of Third-Party Services for Production-Grade Apps.

By default, 🏗 Scaffold-ETH 2 provides predefined API keys for popular services such as Alchemy and Etherscan. This allows you to begin developing and testing your applications more easily, avoiding the need to register for these services.  
This is great to complete your **SpeedRunEthereum**.

For production-grade applications, it's recommended to obtain your own API keys (to prevent rate limiting issues). You can configure these at:

- 🔷`ALCHEMY_API_KEY` variable in `packages/hardhat/.env` and `packages/nextjs/.env.local`. You can create API keys from the [Alchemy dashboard](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/).

- 📃`ETHERSCAN_API_KEY` variable in `packages/hardhat/.env` with your generated API key. You can get your key [here](https://etherscan.io/myapikey).

> 💬 Hint: It's recommended to store env's for nextjs in Vercel/system env config for live apps and use .env.local for local testing.

---

## Checkpoint 9: 📜 Contract Verification

Run the `yarn verify --network your_network` command to verify your contracts on etherscan 🛰

👉 Search this address on Etherscan to get the URL you submit to 🏃‍♀️[SpeedRunEthereum.com](https://speedrunethereum.com).

## Checkpoint 10: 💪 Flex!

👩‍❤️‍👨 Send some $BAL and share your public url with a friend and ask them to swap their tokens :)
